provide a foundational understanding of
the options and capabilities available when designing Promotions. The
Enactor Promotions Engine is extremely powerful and flexible while
remaining easy to manage. The Enactor Promotions Engine provides nearly
limitless capabilities when defining offer qualifications and rewards.</p><h2></h2><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overview">Overview<a href="#overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overview" title="Direct link to Overview">​</a></h2><p>All activity required to define and configure a new offer is completed
within the Promotions Maintenance application. However, offer behaviour
can be influenced by additional factors such as Regions, Locations, MMG
hierarchy, Brands, Product Groups, Loyalty Programmes and many others.
Therefore, a system should be fully configured and loaded with all
master data before proceeding with Promotions setup.</p><h1>Prerequisites</h1><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="resources">Resources<a href="#resources" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Resources" title="Direct link to Resources">​</a></h2><p>Before starting, you should have the following resources in place:</p><ul><li><p>Enactor Estate Manager</p></li><li><p>Enactor POS (configured within the UK Region, connected to the
Estate Manager)</p></li><li><p>Standard Configuration, including:</p><ul><li><p>Base Configuration</p></li><li><p>UK Retail (I have used UK in this example, but it could be other
regional config packs.)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Regionally appropriate data including Product, Localisation,
Tenders, Vouchers etc.</p></li><li><p>Customer configuration including Loyalty, Tiers and Groups</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prior-trainingexperience">Prior Training/Experience<a href="#prior-trainingexperience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Prior Training/Experience" title="Direct link to Prior Training/Experience">​</a></h2><p>You should be familiar with the following:</p><ul><li><p>Estate Manager configuration</p></li><li><p>Enactor configuration concepts, including Locations, POS Terminals,
Products etc.</p></li><li><p>Data broadcasting</p></li><li><p>Standard POS Sales processes</p></li></ul><h1>Promotion Fundamentals</h1><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nature-of-the-promotion">Nature of the promotion<a href="#nature-of-the-promotion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Nature of the promotion" title="Direct link to Nature of the promotion">​</a></h2><p>The Enactor Promotions Engine categorizes all promotions into one of two
types: either Transaction Level or Item Level. Transaction Level
Promotion rewards are applied against the entire transaction. Item Level
rewards are applied to specific items or groups of items in a
transaction.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="promotion-trigger">Promotion Trigger<a href="#promotion-trigger" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Promotion Trigger" title="Direct link to Promotion Trigger">​</a></h2><p>Transaction Level Promotions are triggered by the entire transaction
meeting the qualifying threshold (value, quantity, points, etc.).
Additional Inclusion/Exclusion rules can be imposed for attributes such
as Loyalty Membership, Customer Segment, Regions, Location and more.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="item-set-inclusionexclusion">Item Set Inclusion/Exclusion<a href="#item-set-inclusionexclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Item Set Inclusion/Exclusion" title="Direct link to Item Set Inclusion/Exclusion">​</a></h2><p>Item Level promotions are triggered by meeting the qualifying threshold
(value, quantity, points, etc.) of a particular item or group of items
within the transaction. As with Transaction Level Promotions, additional
Inclusion/Exclusion rules can be imposed for attributes such as Loyalty
Membership, Customer Segment, Regions, Location and more.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="promotion-reward">Promotion Reward<a href="#promotion-reward" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Promotion Reward" title="Direct link to Promotion Reward">​</a></h2><p>When a Promotion is triggered, a Reward is provided. The specific type
and value of the Reward are defined as part of the Promotion
Configuration. A large number of Reward types are supported including
Discounts, Vouchers, Free Items, Fee Override, Gift Cards and others.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="manner-of-application">Manner of Application<a href="#manner-of-application" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Manner of Application" title="Direct link to Manner of Application">​</a></h2><p>The manner in which a Reward is applied is defined through configuration
and is specific to the Promotion. This includes the ability to define
how the Reward behaves during returns and how it interacts with other
Promotions, Discounts and Overrides.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="promotion-timetable">Promotion Timetable<a href="#promotion-timetable" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Promotion Timetable" title="Direct link to Promotion Timetable">​</a></h2><p>Promotions are typically effective over a specific range of dates.
Beginning and ending dates can be specified for each offer. Promotions
can also be limited to be active only during specific times of the day
and/or on specific days of the week.</p><h1>Configuration</h1><p>Enactor supports multiple Promotion types, rewards, application methods,
qualification and include/exclude criteria. This guide focuses on the
core concepts which can then be replicated across numerous variations.
For a detailed account of all available options, please refer to the
full Enactor Application Configuration book.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="page123image41549040" src="/assets/images/image2-6cd3787c90fad26566d411ef7fe79d9a.png" width="694" height="202" class="img_ev3q">Access Promotions using the Promotions
option, obtained via the selection sequence shown at right, starting
from the Main Menu:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graphical user interface, application, table Description automatically generated" src="/assets/images/image3-3adabe6a6afdc8c6e99bd78d81dd782b.png" width="1567" height="830" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>On the Promotion Maintenance page, select &quot;Create a new Promotion&quot;.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A picture containing background pattern Description automatically generated" src="/assets/images/image4-3647ff04aedaca5699267f488e488970.png" width="1567" height="223" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>If the Promotion is being created for a specific Region, select it from
the list. Otherwise, it can be left as &quot;All Regions&quot;. Each Promotion
must have a unique Promotion ID per Region. This can be automatically generated if one is not specified.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="manner-of-application-1">Manner of Application<a href="#manner-of-application-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Manner of Application" title="Direct link to Manner of Application">​</a></h2><p>Numerous tabs are displayed within Promotion Maintenance. The options
displayed on the General tabs primarily impact how the Promotion is
applied.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to -1" title="Direct link to -1">​</a></h4><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" src="/assets/images/image5-c2b5308c41258a9c97134d546f55fcc9.png" width="1567" height="1063" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>On the General -- General tab, a Description is required for the
Promotion. This is the Description that will be shown on the operator
display and receipt when the promotion is triggered. The Notes field is
provided to allow a more detailed description of the Promotion for
internal reference. The Notes are not visible to the cashier or
customer.</p><p>When multiple combinations of Promotions could be applied to a
transaction the Promotions Engine uses Best Deal Logic to select the
combination that results in the highest discount to the customer. If a
retailer wishes to override the Best Deal Logic and force certain
Promotions to be chosen over others, the behaviour can be manipulated by
applying a Best Deal Priority. This feature should be used only when
absolutely necessary as it may result in unexpected results especially
in highly promotional environments.</p><p>When setting up Item Level Promotions, it is possible to have multiple
Item Sets. Some Item Sets may have a reward associated while other Item
Sets only exist for qualification. As an example, a Promotion may be
defined to discount items 10% from merchandise category &#x27;B&#x27; if the
customer spends at least £20 on items in merchandise category &#x27;A&#x27;. Under
normal circumstances, the transaction XML in this example would only
show a discount applied to items from merchandise category &#x27;B&#x27; even
though the items in merchandise category &#x27;A&#x27; were technically part of
the promotion. If the option to &quot;Distribute Savings Over All Promotion
Items&quot; is selected, the transaction XML would then show the total
discount amount distributed proportionally across the items from both
merchandise categories. This option has no impact on the amount of
discount given and is transparent to the cashier and customer. This
change is made only to comply with the retailer&#x27;s accounting practices.</p><p>If a Promotion is allowed to overlap with other Promotions or Discounts,
selections should be made for &quot;Operation with Previous Promotions&quot; and
&quot;Operation with Discounts&quot;. The available selections will determine when
the promotion can apply and if it should calculate using gross or net
price.</p><p>If a promotion can only be used a certain number of times within a
single transaction it should be specified in the &quot;Limit Number of
Promotions&quot; field. If no entry is made, the Promotion will trigger as
many times as needed.</p><p>There may be circumstances where it is appropriate to alert the operator
that a particular Promotion has been triggered and require their
acknowledgement. Selecting &quot;Force Acknowledge Triggered Alert&quot; will
result in a pop-up message being displayed when triggered. When this
option is selected, an additional input field is displayed on the form
for the &quot;Triggered Alert Message&quot; to specify the message sent to the
operator.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image6-aec7bb792cc09dcad53cfa5031df7ed0.png" width="1567" height="152" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Similarly, it is possible to &quot;Alert Operator When Nearly Triggered&quot;
indicating the customer has almost qualified for a Promotion. This is
frequently used to entice the customer to make additional purchases if
they are close to qualifying for a reward. When this option is selected,
an additional input field is displayed on the form for the &quot;Near Miss
Alert Message&quot; to specify the message sent to the operator.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image7-bb3e7dfe4e6df34c78e1d2545adafd02.png" width="1567" height="152" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>If the Promotion is set to &quot;Alert Operator When Nearly Triggered&quot; an
additional threshold will be defined to specify when this alert should
be sent. Thresholds are reviewed later in this document.</p><p>The General -- Returns tab controls atypical Promotion behaviour during
return transactions. These settings do not need to be changed to
accommodate normal return transactions. If a receipted return is done on
a transaction that has been reduced by a promotion, that will
automatically be included in the refund.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graphical user interface, text, email Description automatically generated" src="/assets/images/image8-ca371440b8b636db878e9c16ca94a483.png" width="1567" height="421" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In some cases, items may be qualifiers for multiple Promotions and
capable of triggering multiple offers in a transaction. Promotions with
some number of common qualifying items are said to Overlap. Retailers
have differing policies on Promotions with some allowing the customer to
claim all rewards possible while others stipulate that an item can only
be used once to qualify for a Promotion. Some retailers, with very
complicated promotional schemes, allow the overlapping of some
promotions while restricting others. The General -- Overlap tab permits
full control of how the promotions should interact together.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" src="/assets/images/image9-76848b5021d6d580d7c5921fbb0c5d82.png" width="1567" height="493" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>To allow the items involved with this Promotion to be used in all other
eligible Promotions, the &quot;Allow Items To Be Used In All Other
Promotions&quot; option should be selected. When this option is selected, the
dropdown selector to add individual Promotions is removed. If the
Promotion is only allowed to Overlap with a limited number of other

Promotion Type requires the Number of Items to Discount, the Discount
Rate and the Rounding Rule to be specified on the Type tab.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" src="/assets/images/image47-f7a09da9c95bc54553df68141574d322.png" width="1568" height="436" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fixed-price">Fixed Price<a href="#fixed-price" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fixed Price" title="Direct link to Fixed Price">​</a></h3><p>This Promotion Type will Reward the customer by applying a Fixed Price
to a group of items as defined in the Item Set. A Fixed Price Promotion
Type is frequently used when selling a bundle of items at a promotional
price independent of their regular prices (i.e., buy any shirt and tie
for £100). The promotional selling price is specified in the Reward
Value not a discount amount.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" src="/assets/images/image48-22a7f51d4f2fe62aa10a73f6e3ee74c6.png" width="1568" height="436" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fixed-price-by-item">Fixed Price by Item<a href="#fixed-price-by-item" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fixed Price by Item" title="Direct link to Fixed Price by Item">​</a></h3><p>This Promotion Type will Reward the customer by applying a Fixed Price
to each item as defined by the item set. In contrast to the previous
Promotion Type, Fixed Price by Item establishes a promotional selling
price for each individual item as opposed to setting a price for a
group/bundle of items. The promotional selling price is specified in the
Reward Value not a discount amount.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" src="/assets/images/image49-932b0fdf13d5bf1700969ab290d19676.png" width="1568" height="436" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="offer-price-promotion">Offer-Price Promotion<a href="#offer-price-promotion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Offer-Price Promotion" title="Direct link to Offer-Price Promotion">​</a></h3><p>This Promotion Type will Reward the customer by applying an alternative

Promotional Coupon Product. By creating a Product to represent a
Promotional Coupon, that Product ID can be included in an Item Set of
the Promotion it is designed to trigger. A Promotional Coupon Product is
a simple way of issuing coupons when single use or serial number
tracking is not required.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="spend-x-get-free-product">Spend X Get Free Product<a href="#spend-x-get-free-product" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Spend X Get Free Product" title="Direct link to Spend X Get Free Product">​</a></h3><p>This Promotion Type will Reward the customer with a Free Product after

Type requires entry of the Free Product ID which can be done directly or
located with Product Search by clicking &quot;Select Product&quot;.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" src="/assets/images/image57-37088181df9faf2e7e81403e84c220aa.png" width="1568" height="443" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="spend-x-get-y-1">Spend X Get Y<a href="#spend-x-get-y-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Spend X Get Y" title="Direct link to Spend X Get Y">​</a></h3><p>This Promotion Type will Reward the customer with a currency Amount
Discount applied to the items as defined in the Item Set. While similar
to the Amount Discount Promotion Type, there are 2 key differences.
First, the Threshold must be expressed in terms of transaction currency
value (thresholds are discussed in a later section). Second, the Reward
amount will be applied every time the Threshold is met.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" src="/assets/images/image58-152dd4d651db05cf9d831aa1d9b6f61d.png" width="1568" height="443" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fee-override">Fee Override<a href="#fee-override" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fee Override" title="Direct link to Fee Override">​</a></h3><p>This Promotion Type will Reward the customer by applying either a
promotional fixed selling price or discount percentage to an item that
is specifically a Fee Product Item. Some examples may be shipping,
delivery or installation fees. To specify a selling price for the Fee
Product Item it should be entered in the Reward Value. Alternatively, a
discount percentage can be entered in the Reward Rate with the
appropriate Rounding Rule.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image59-68b9a8d7d9e45936a25600ed85a798ce.png" width="1568" height="462" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-3"><a href="#-3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to -3" title="Direct link to -3">​</a></h3><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="item-set-threshold-types">Item Set Threshold Types<a href="#item-set-threshold-types" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Item Set Threshold Types" title="Direct link to Item Set Threshold Types">​</a></h2><p>All Item Set Promotions utilise the same form to define qualification
Threshold.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" src="/assets/images/image60-68017ee3aedac851eae26eecb5ddb291.png" width="1568" height="462" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>There are 3 Threshold Types that can be used with Transaction
Promotions:</p><ul><li><p>Count: The number of items in the Item Set</p></li><li><p>Value: The value of all items in the Item Set</p></li><li><p>Points: The number of loyalty points earned in the Item Set</p></li></ul><p>After selecting the Threshold Type from the dropdown, enter the desired
Threshold Value in the provided field.</p><p>If the Promotion has been configured to &quot;Alert Operator When Nearly
Triggered&quot; an additional Threshold field will be shown. This is labeled
as the Alert Threshold and represents the condition that must be
satisfied to trigger the alert.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" src="/assets/images/image61-837e4061081c084bb70d5ab19f2e05cc.png" width="1568" height="527" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Additional Threshold options exist for Item Sets that do not exist for
Transaction Promotions. By selecting the Items Must Be Unique To Trigger
option, permits the use of a specific product only once for
qualification no matter how many times it appears in the transaction.</p><p>Using the Products, Brands, Product Groups and MM Groups tabs to create
Include/Exclude lists for Item Sets was reviewed previously in this
document. When creating an Item Set that is to include most products, it
is also possible to set the Include Any Item In The Transaction option
on the Threshold tab. Select this option moves all products into an
&#x27;Include&#x27; status and will remove the Include tabs from the Products,
Brands, Product Groups and MM Groups tabs. It is still possible to
specify Excludes on those tabs.</p><p>By default, a reward will trigger once after an Item Set Threshold is
reached. In some cases, it may be desirable to have the reward continue
to trigger for each additional item after the threshold has been met.
Imagine a promotion where the customer receives a 10% discount when they
buy 3 or more shirts. The discount would trigger after the 3^rd^ shirt
was scanned but if a fourth shirt was purchased no discount would be
applied as the Item Set Threshold is now reset. By enabling the After
Threshold Trigger On Each Item option, every shirt scanned after the
3^rd^ shirt would also receive the 10% discount.</p><p>While it is possible to allow various Promotions and Rewards to Overlap
as discussed earlier it is possible to prevent items from being used to
satisfy thresholds in multiple Item Sets without disturbing the reward
overlap. Selecting the Exclude Trigger Items from Other Item Sets option
will prevent a single item from being used for qualification in multiple
Item Sets.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a
