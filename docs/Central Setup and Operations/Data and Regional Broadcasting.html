class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2><p>The purpose of this guide is to demonstrate how to configure broadcasts that are used to distribute configuration throughout the estate to meet organizational needs.
All data is managed and maintained centrally in the Estate Manager. To apply configuration changes across the estate, the user will need to broadcast configurations using the Enactor broadcast function. The data broadcasting function in Enactor is fundamentally for selecting configuration elements (entities) that require distribution and identifying the target devices that they should be distributed to. This targeted distribution of the configured data to distributed systems of Enactor retail applications can be achieved in both manual and automated procedures with administration options to configure and manage them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overview">Overview<a href="#overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overview" title="Direct link to Overview">​</a></h2><p>This guide will cover the following configuration entities: </p><ul><li><strong>Prerequisites for Broadcasting</strong> – Providing an understanding of how active subscriptions work and how they can be managed for devices. </li><li><strong>Predefined Broadcast Configuration</strong> – Defining the key requirements and setting up broadcasts to be sent across the estate. </li><li><strong>Data Broadcaster Configuration</strong> – Enable manual distribution of specific data to devices across the estate as specified in the predefined broadcasts. </li><li><strong>Broadcast Status</strong> – Monitoring the status of the broadcasts locally as well as in the Estate Manager to make sure that they are successfully completed. </li><li><strong>Troubleshooting Broadcast Issues</strong> – Tackling and fixing broadcast issues that may arise during broadcasting.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prerequisites-for-broadcasting">Prerequisites for Broadcasting<a href="#prerequisites-for-broadcasting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Prerequisites for Broadcasting" title="Direct link to Prerequisites for Broadcasting">​</a></h2><p>To perform broadcasts successfully, the user must ensure that the intended target devices for broadcasts are subscribed before performing any broadcasts. Without the device being subscribed, the Estate Manager will not be able to communicate with the devices. If correctly installed, any device at start-up will connect to the Estate Manager Server and will be automatically subscribed. Once subscribed, the Estate Manager will be able to target that device or the range of devices and broadcast data directly to them. If the device has not been subscribed, it will not receive the broadcasted updates, and such failure to subscribe may happen due to network issues or firewall restrictions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="active-subscriptions-management">Active Subscriptions Management<a href="#active-subscriptions-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Active Subscriptions Management" title="Direct link to Active Subscriptions Management">​</a></h3><p>Active Subscription Management option provides a means to monitor and manage the subscriptions to queues from Devices in the Estate. Before performing any broadcasts, it is better to check if the device has already been subscribed.<br>
<!-- -->To check if the device is subscribed, follow the steps below:</p><p>The Active Subscriptions Management application can be accessed through:
Administration -&gt; Message Service -&gt; Active Subscriptions Management</p><p> <img loading="lazy" alt="Picure54" src="/assets/images/Picture54-0a4d798fe5a253d6ee3cb8416fce11cb.jpg" width="1100" height="326" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The <strong>Active Subscriptions</strong> page lists all subscriptions to all queues for all Devices. The user is enabled to perform a filtered search of any of the Enactor messaging queues and/or the Client ID as shown below. The Client ID contains the device ID and is considered the best way to determine if a device has been subscribed to the queues.  </p><p>Following are the Enactor messaging queues: </p><ul><li>AllStores – Every device in the enactor estate will subscribe to this queue. </li><li>Device – This is a device-specific queue. </li><li>Location – This is a location-specific queue. Once a device has been loaded in a valid location, it will subscribe to this queue. </li><li>Region – This is a region-specific queue and once a device has been loaded in a valid region it will subscribe to this queue. </li></ul><p>Enter the Client ID (Device ID) of the device that you wish to monitor the subscription status in the Client ID filter space and select the apply filter option.
The subscribe status of the selected device will be listed as shown below in the example. The below example shows that the <strong><a href="mailto:pos1@0001.enactor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pos1@0001.enactor</a></strong> device is successfully subscribed to all the messaging queues and is ready to receive broadcasts from the Estate Manager.</p><p> <img loading="lazy" alt="Picure55" src="/assets/images/Picture55-6fd3408ae94e02077cda1e45eae267f1.jpg" width="780" height="330" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="configuration-steps">Configuration Steps<a href="#configuration-steps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Configuration Steps" title="Direct link to Configuration Steps">​</a></h2><p>Predefined Broadcasts are persistent, reusable entities that define the key requirements of a broadcast. This allows the user to create a broadcast, add or remove the entities they wish to broadcast and then target the broadcast to exactly where they wish to send the configurations.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="predefined-broadcast">Predefined Broadcast<a href="#predefined-broadcast" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Predefined Broadcast" title="Direct link to Predefined Broadcast">​</a></h3><p>To create a new Predefined Broadcast, follow the steps below:</p><p>The Predefined Broadcast Maintenance application can be accessed through:

These entities would have been configured only for a particular region or location. However, when the usual broadcasts are done, even the entities that are not a part of that region or location are broadcasted, which in turn broadcasts a large amount of unnecessary data to that device. </p><p>Following is an example scenario:
A parent region is set to All Regions with UK and US as its Child Regions. Tenders are configured in the Tender Maintenace separately for UK and US regions. A new device is set up in the UK region and requires the Tenders that are configured only for the UK region to be broadcasted.  However, this cannot be done by broadcasting the <strong>Tender</strong> entity to the new device in the UK region, as it will broadcast all the US tender configurations as well, which is unnecessary data for the device in the UK region. </p><p>For this purpose, the “Tender by Region” entity in the Details tab of Predefined Broadcast Maintenance is used, which ensures that the entities are distributed only to specified regions. There are many such entities for both Region and Location, which are listed and shown in the next sub-section. With this option, broadcasts can be sent to All Regions or Stores in the estate, but will only impact the respective regions or locations to which the entities have been configured.
