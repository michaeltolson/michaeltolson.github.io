Sales</h1><h1>Introduction</h1><p>The purpose of this guide is to show how to configure various aspects to
effectively manage Employee Sales. While Enactor supports multiple ways
of providing products at a discount to Employees, this guide will focus
on the Employee Sale which provides the most robust flexibility and
control.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overview">Overview<a href="#overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overview" title="Direct link to Overview">​</a></h2><p>The following areas will be reviewed as part of configuring the Employee
Sale:</p><ul><li><p>Employees</p></li><li><p>Reason Codes</p></li><li><p>Employee Cards</p></li><li><p>Employee Grades</p></li><li><p>Employee Accounts</p></li><li><p>Promotions</p></li></ul><h1>Prerequisites</h1><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="resources">Resources<a href="#resources" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Resources" title="Direct link to Resources">​</a></h2><p>Before starting, you should have the following resources in place:</p><ul><li><p>Enactor Estate Manager</p></li><li><p>Enactor POS (configured within the UK Region, connected to the
Estate Manager)</p></li><li><p>Standard Configuration, including:</p><ul><li><p>Base Configuration</p></li><li><p>UK Retail (I have used UK in this example, but it could be other
regional config packs. If you import the UK Retail config, the
tax configuration described will already exist. Please note that
in this guide we will go through the process of creating the
configuration from scratch, as an example.)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Examples of Data to be used as models, particularly Employee</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prior-trainingexperience">Prior Training/Experience<a href="#prior-trainingexperience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Prior Training/Experience" title="Direct link to Prior Training/Experience">​</a></h2><p>You should be familiar with the following:</p><ul><li><p>Estate Manager configuration</p></li><li><p>Enactor configuration concepts, including Locations, POS Terminals,
Products, Discounts, Promotions etc.</p></li><li><p>Data broadcasting</p></li><li><p>Standard POS Sales processes</p></li></ul><h1>Fundamentals</h1><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="selling-to-employees">Selling to Employees<a href="#selling-to-employees" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Selling to Employees" title="Direct link to Selling to Employees">​</a></h2><p>Retailers understand that having employees who use, understand and are
passionate about the products and services that they offer can be an
asset. By providing additional discounts to their employees, retailers
not only get product into the hands of the people responsible for
selling it but also create an important recruiting and retention tool.
Tighter margins have caused many retailers to reduce or eliminate
Employee Discounts.</p><p>The Enactor solution supports numerous options on ways to manage an
Employee Sale. Discounts can be calculated and applied based on the
Employee, Employee Grade, Employee Group or MM Group. Additionally,
Employees can be limited on the value of product purchased or amount of
discount received over a period of time. The Enactor Promotions Engine
can even be leveraged to create meaningful Employee-only offers that can
help increase basket size and recover lost margin.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="manual-employee-discounts">Manual Employee Discounts<a href="#manual-employee-discounts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Manual Employee Discounts" title="Direct link to Manual Employee Discounts">​</a></h2><p>While not covered in detail within this guide, Enactor does support the
use of manually applied Employee Discounts. These are created and
managed using Item and Transaction Discount Reason Codes and therefore
do not offer the enhanced flexibility and control found when using the
Employee Sale Transaction Type.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="employee-sale">Employee Sale<a href="#employee-sale" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Employee Sale" title="Direct link to Employee Sale">​</a></h2><p>An Employee Sale is a unique Transaction Type within the Enactor
solution. This provides the ability to reconsider any number of business
rules and change their behaviour when compared to a traditional retail
transaction. In addition to specifying the type of discount, an Employee
Sale Reason also has the ability to enforce employee validation, track
spending/received discount, enforce allowable tenders as well as other
discount related parameters.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="discount-types">Discount Types<a href="#discount-types" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Discount Types" title="Direct link to Discount Types">​</a></h2><p>There are many different Discount Types that can be supported by an
Employee Sale. Each Discount Type will drive various configuration
requirements:</p><p> <strong>Fixed:</strong> All employees receive a single, fixed Discount Percentage
as specified in the Employee Sale Reason.</p><p> <strong>Employee:</strong> When selecting the Employee Discount Type, the discount
percentage is specified within the Employee Record which permits the
use of different discount percentages for different employees. This
Discount Type supports a 2-level discount scheme which utilises an
accumulated discount balance threshold to determine the appropriate
level.</p><p> <strong>Employee Spend:</strong> Similar to the Employee Discount Type above with
the exception that accumulated spend balance is used to affect the
discount level. Spend is based on the pre-discount value of
merchandise.</p><p> <strong>Employee Grade:</strong> The Employee Grade Discount Type permits assigning
a Discount Percentage based on the Employees Grade within the
organisation. As with the Employee Discount Type mentioned previously,
a 2-level discount scheme can be defined which utilises an accumulated
discount balance to select the appropriate level.</p><p> <strong>Employee Grade Spend:</strong> This Discount Type is selected when it is
preferred to use an accumulated spend balance to select the
appropriate Employee Grade discount level. Spend is based on the
pre-discount value of merchandise.</p><p> <strong>Employee Grade By MMG:</strong> This is a variation of the Employee Grade
Discount Type. When selecting Employee Grade by MMG, it is possible to
specify 2 discount levels for multiple MM Groups. A pre-set
accumulated discount threshold is used to determine discount level as
with other Discount Types. The Employee Grade by MMG Discount Type
also permits specifying discounts by Product ID.</p><p> <strong>Employee Grade Spend By MMG:</strong> Conceptually similar to the above
Discount Type with the exception that accumulated spend is used to
determine discount level. Spend is based on the pre-discount value of
merchandise.</p><p> <strong>Promotions:</strong> While not an actual Discount Type, it is worth noting
that the Enactor Promotions Engine supports the utilisation of
Promotions within an Employee Sale. Promotions for general customers
can be allowed within an Employee Sale and Promotions can be
configured to only be available in Employee Sales. Promotions can also
be specific to Employee Grades as well as Employee Groups. Promotions
can be used in conjunction with all the Discount Types mentioned
above. The discount amount received from a Promotion can contribute to
the accumulated discount balance.</p><h1>Configuration</h1><p>Each Discount Type mentioned previously drives a different approach for
configuration. The following sections on the configuration of Employees,
Employee Sale Reason Type and Employee Cards cover the core settings
that are independent of Discount Type. Additional instructions specific
to each Discount Type are found later in the document.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="employee-configuration">Employee Configuration<a href="#employee-configuration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Employee Configuration" title="Direct link to Employee Configuration">​</a></h2><p>Enactor maintains Employee records independently from User records for
the purpose of managing Employee Sales. It is important to note that
these entities are truly independent so that a User record entry does
not imply an Employee record. Typically, Employee data will be
interfaced to Enactor from a 3^rd^ party system, but we will cover
manual entry in this guide to reinforce the concepts.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="page206image32244128" src="/assets/images/image1-ffdd1ef3f25d82efa6e1a22a4743dc65.png" width="599" height="174" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Employees are defined using the Employees option, obtained <em>via</em> the
selection sequence shown at right starting from the Main Menu:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Table Description automatically generated" src="/assets/images/image2-46b4d87d18f65a087310688c44901b5f.png" width="1699" height="621" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>To create a new Employee record, click &#x27;Create a new Employee&#x27;.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image3-b552141138b44381cafe7028d43822d4.png" width="1699" height="199" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The Employee ID can be entered, or the system can be generated.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" src="/assets/images/image4-f79cad11315fb21093c70bf3fb0c1835.png" width="1396" height="1055" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Very limited information is mandatory in the Employee record. Some of
the optional fields directly influence the Employee Sale functionality
regardless of the Discount Type selected. The Normal Working Location
ties an Employee to a Location which can be helpful when searching for
an Employee. The Automatic Employee Sale option initiates an Employee
Sale when the Employee is added to the transaction via Loyalty if
enabled. When using the Automatic Employee Sale option, select the
Employee Sale Reason from the dropdown.</p><p>The following options are handled differently depending on the Employee
Discount Type being used: Employee Grade, Employee Discount, Employee
Allowance Discount and Employee Discount Allowance. Configuration of
these options will be reviewed by Discount Type later in this document.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="employee-sale-reason-type">Employee Sale Reason Type<a href="#employee-sale-reason-type" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Employee Sale Reason Type" title="Direct link to Employee Sale Reason Type">​</a></h2><p>The configuration of Reasons is covered in a separate guide. Please
refer to that guide for information on navigating to and use of the
Reason Maintenance application.</p><p>The Employee Sale Reason Type governs the authorization and business
rules when executing an Employee Sale transaction.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" src="/assets/images/image5-27991245698cf93dab56cac4c0eef771.png" width="1396" height="516" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The General tab is consistent with all other Reason Types.

discount eligibility and discount methodology.</p><p>The Capture Employee ID option requires that an Employee ID be entered
at the start of an Employee Sale. If the Employee ID is to be validated,
the Check in Employee Database option must also be selected. If an
Employee Card with a number different from the Employee ID is to be used
for validation the Validate Employee Card option should be selected. See
the following section on configuring Employee Cards if appropriate.</p><p>Additional Settings on the Employee Sale tab can impact how discounts
are applied regardless of the Discount Type being used. The Discount
Applies After Promotions will apply the selected discount after any
eligible Promotions are applied. The Allow Overlap? option permits the
Employee Sale Discount to overlap with other Reason Type driven
Discounts. The Exclude Receipt Return Items will not apply the Employee
Sale Discount to items that are part of a Receipt Return assuming they
were originally purchased without an Employee Sale Discount.</p><p>Many of the remaining settings will be used differently depending on the

2-tier discount scheme. This permits a retailer to offer a higher
Employee Discount amount initially but reduce it once an employee has
received a certain level of benefits over a period of time. The
following example assumes that the accumulated discount balance will be
tracked within Enactor.</p><p>Configuration of the Employee Sale Reason is done in the same manner
mentioned previously with a few additional settings.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" src="/assets/images/image20-c4c2890dd5ae6e230a6177a8b7fb3698.png" width="1293" height="1003" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Selecting the Affect Employee Balance? initiates the processes needed to
validate and update employee balances. The Commit Balance Online option
indicates that the tracking will be done within Enactor. The Adjust
Balance by option indicates if the discount levels are based on
accumulated Discount or Spend. In this case, the balance will be
maintained by accumulated Discount.</p><p>The Employee Record is configured in the same manner as before, but
additional options will now be specified.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" src="/assets/images/image21-a62abc1e63d6dc9a59abbf520e857a6d.png" width="1579" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>To configure a 2-level discount scheme, the initial discount amount is
entered as the Employee Allowance Discount. The discount amount after
the threshold is exceeded is entered as the Employee Discount. The
threshold amount is the Employee Discount Allowance.</p><p>In the example above, an Employee will receive a 20% employee discount
at the start of a period. Once they have accumulated \$500 in Employee
Discounts, they will only receive a 5% discount through the end of the
period.</p><p>When using a Discount Type that depends on Balance Tracking, an Employee
Account must be created. This is where the balance will be maintained.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="page213image20615232" src="/assets/images/image22-dffdc08b997e86e726329280ec4376d8.png" width="694" height="202" class="img_ev3q">Employee Accounts are maintained using the Employee

also be done by Employee Groups. The configuration of Employee Groups is
reviewed below.</p><p>The general creation of Groups is discussed in the Organisation
